 A monthly goal planner, which allows users to set their tasks for current month and
mark them done. The goals unachieved in the end of the month will be displayed to
the user; so that he can be more persistent towards completion of his/her monthly
goals.

 An activity tracker, where the user will not have any time duration to complete the
task, but he will have to do it/ complete it in some fixed interval. Users can be notified
to complete the task, or they not be notified. Users will have to check in for their task
to mark an interval complete. We can have streaks for user to further motivate them
to complete their goals in time.
